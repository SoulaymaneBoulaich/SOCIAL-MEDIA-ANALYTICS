1oy6bjm,reddit,How to get AFCON 2025 tickets now that all 3 phases are done?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been trying to buy AFCON 2025 tickets from the official CAF website since Phase 1. I live in the US, so each time I had to join the queue between midnight and 6am Pacific Time. Every single time I got kicked out of the queue, and by the time I reached the front again, everything was sold out.

Now that all 3 official phases are finished, does anyone know **how to get tickets at this point?**

I want to stay fully official and avoid scams. I know the CAF site mentions an “official resale platform,” but I can’t find any actual resale page or marketplace anywhere.

**Questions:**

1. Has anyone successfully bought resale tickets through the CAF platform?
2. Does the resale section actually appear somewhere, or do tickets just pop up randomly if someone lists them?
3. Are there any legitimate ways to still secure tickets now?

Any advice or experience would really help. Thanks!",4,10,2025-11-16 00:33:25,Remarkable-Grade-880,https://www.reddit.com/r/FootballAfrica/comments/1oy6bjm/how_to_get_afcon_2025_tickets_now_that_all_3/

After Nigeria's awful qualifiers too (and only in playoffs because FIFA doesn't recognise points against 6th-bottom teams in a group which Nigeria only managed 2 draws against Zimbabwe), they get handed this late goal...👀👀🤑

Then game levelled out fairly after Lemina's deflected shot

Nigeris admittedly were more prepared for the AET and putting their chances to bed
